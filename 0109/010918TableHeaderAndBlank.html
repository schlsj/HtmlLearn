		</table>
		<p>show the table head, but in fact it is a column header</p>
		<p>show the blank cells, to show the border, we didn't use a blank td label, but a &nbsp; td</p>
		<p>but infact, even the cell is empty, it just show like &nbsp;</p>
		<p>now i add a caption to the table, and i think i'll add many thing to it.</p>
		<p>now i add the span(row and column) to the table.<br/>
		colspan is easy to understand, but rowspan is not so direct</p>
